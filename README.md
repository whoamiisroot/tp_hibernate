# Hibernate Lab Readme

This lab consists of four exercises that can all be run in a similar manner. Follow the steps below to run the exercises successfully.

## Exercise Steps

### Step 1: Create a Database
- Start by creating a database. For example, the first lab might have a database named `hibernate1`. Make sure the database is created and accessible.

### Step 2: Check `hibernate.cfg.xml` Configuration
- Open the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file and ensure that the configuration is correct. Check for the following details:
  - Database connection URL, username, and password.
  - Mapping details for the entities.
  - Other Hibernate configurations specific to your exercise.

### Step 3: Run the Test Class
- Navigate to the `ma.projet.test` package.
- Run the `Test.java` class within the package. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are present and that the classpath is set up correctly.

## Additional Notes
- Make sure that the necessary libraries and dependencies are added to the project.
- Ensure that the database connection details in the configuration file are accurate and match the database you have created.
- Check the console or logs for any error messages during the process.
